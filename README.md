React Notes App
Introduction
I recently embarked on a journey to enhance my app development skills efficiently using the React framework. Throughout this learning process, I delved into various React concepts such as components, JSX syntax, props, and mapping.

This repository contains a small project – a notes app – that I built as part of this learning experience. The app is designed to help you keep track of your notes effortlessly.

Technologies Used
React: The app is built using the React framework, which allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

React Components: I've structured the app using React components to modularize and organize the code effectively.

JSX: JSX (JavaScript XML) is used to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making the development of UI components more intuitive.

Props: The app utilizes React props to pass data between components, enhancing reusability and maintainability.

Mapping: I've implemented mapping to dynamically render components based on the data provided, making the app scalable and flexible.

Features
Note Creation: Easily create new notes with a title and content.

Note Display: All your notes are displayed in a clean and organized manner.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to work seamlessly on various devices.
